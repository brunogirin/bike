*Bicycle Accessories for 3D Printing*

This project is a collection of 3D models of bicycle accessories that are
meant to be printed on a 3D printer. The source files are written in the 
[openscad](http://www.openscad.org/) language and are compiled into STL
files suitable for use by a 3D printer.

At the moment, the project includes a single 3D model of an adapter to fit a
CatEye rear rack mount light bracket to a Madison panier rack.

To create all STL files in the project:

    make

To clean all build artefacts:
